# ðŸš€ nanoCNN: A GPU-Accelerated CNN Framework from Scratch  

**No PyTorch. No TensorFlow. Just NumPy, CuPy, and math.**  

A high-performance convolutional neural network (CNN) framework implemented **from scratch** using only NumPy and CuPy, with hybrid PyTorch autograd for gradient verification. Built for education, optimization, and understanding the internals of deep learning frameworks.

## ðŸ”¥ Key Features  
- **GPU Acceleration**: Leverages CuPy for **10x speedup** over NumPy on MNIST.  
- **Custom Autograd**: Hybrid CuPy/PyTorch implementation for **correct gradient computation**.  
- **From-Scratch Innovations**:  
  - Adam optimizer **with bias correction** (missing in most tutorials).  
  - He initialization, batch-normalized gradients.  
  - Efficient conv2d backprop via **cross-correlation**.  
- **Educational**: Clean, modular code with **derivation notes** in comments.
